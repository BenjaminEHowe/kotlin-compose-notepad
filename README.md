# Kotlin Compose Notepad
This is a simple notepad application written using Kotlin and the [Compose UI framework](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/).
It is based on the [official notepad example](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/tree/master/examples/notepad) with some small adjustments.
